## AppStore submit notice
Starting from version 1.6.0 Yandex AppMetrica became also a tracking instrument and
uses Apple idfa to attribute installs. Because of that during submitting your
application to the AppStore you will be prompted with three checkboxes to state
your intentions for idfa usage.
As Yandex AppMetrica uses idfa for attributing app installations you need to select **Attribute this app installation to a previously served
advertisement**.

* Added API to send crashes from arbitrary plugins: protocols `YMMYandexMetricaPlugins` (to receive the object implementing this protocol invoke method `YMMYandexMetrica.getPluginExtension`), `YMMYandexMetricaPluginReporting` (to receive the object implementing this protocol invoke method `YMMYandexMetricaReporting.getPluginExtension`), as well as classes `YMMPluginErrorDetails`, `YMMStackTraceElement`.
* Added API for plugins that is required for full SDK functioning in terms of sessions auto-tracking when activated from plugins: `YMMYandexMetricaPlugins.handlePluginInitFinished`.
* Added the capability to send errors from reporters without main API key activation. In this case, the errors will not contain meta-information retrieved from KSCrash (system info).
